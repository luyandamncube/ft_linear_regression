# ft_linear_regression
Data Science: Linear Regression

Really hope I ACTUALLY finish this project :( 

Don't really know what I'm doing with this one but the plan is to accelerate my data science learning using the `ft_linear_regression` and hopefully the `DSLR` (Datascience X Logistic Regression) modules at 42. Found one other [person](https://github.com/SpenderJ/Linear_Regression) doing the project on github. This is the first project in the deep learning branch at 42.
