# ft_linear_regression
Data Science: Linear Regression

Really hope I ACTUALLY finish this project :( 

Don't really know what I'm doing with this one but the plan is to accelerate my data science learning using the `ft_linear_regression` and hopefully the `DSLR` (Datascience X Logistic Regression) modules at 42. Found one other [person](https://github.com/SpenderJ/Linear_Regression) doing the project on github. This is the first project in the deep learning branch at 42. 

## Linear Regression
* [Linear Regression](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/) is a topic in statistics that is used as a predictive analysis tool.
* It aims to form relationships between data points and:
1. determining the strength of predictors, 
2. forecasting an effect,
3. trend forecasting.

## Objective
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on it's mileage.

## Topics covered
* Statistics
* Predictive Analysis
* Regression Modelling
